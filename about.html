        <a class="textleft">I was born in Indianapolis, IN at Methodist Hospital on April 10, 1984. There was a dark cloud that hovered over the town that day. My Mother and Father met while my Father was in America, getting his masters degree in electrical engineering. My mother had just graduated from college, and was beginning her career as a music teacher. They were married in 1979, and had my older brother in 1981. By the time they had me, they had moved to the northside of Indianapolis, and were ready to have another baby after their first one was kind of a disappointment. My parents finally got it right with their third child, who would go on to be a college graduate and make a lot of money. While my family has been saving the world from enemies, I went to Indiana University and majored in General Studies. I really enjoyed learning about business and political science.</a> <br><br>
